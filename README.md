# Data Structures in C: Stack Abstract Data Type (ADT) â€” Linked List and Array Implementations

Welcome to the companion code repository for an undergraduate course on Data Structures. This repository contains educational code for the **Stack Abstract Data Type (ADT)** in C, with two separate modules:  
- A **linked list implementation** (`stackLinkedList/stackADT_linked.c`)  
- An **array implementation** (`stackArray/stackADT_array.c`)  

Both are organized in separate directories for clarity. This repository is designed for students new to GitHub, C programming, and command-line tools, with a strong focus on hands-on learning and conceptual understanding.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Set Up and Run the Code

### 1. Downloading the Repository

#### **Option A: Download as ZIP (No GitHub Account Needed)**
1. Go to the repository page in your web browser.
2. Click the green **"Code"** button.
3. Select **"Download ZIP"**.
4. Extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.

#### **Option B: Clone with Git (Recommended for Future Updates)**
1. Install Git if you don't have it:
   - **Linux**: Open Terminal and run:  
     `sudo apt update && sudo apt install git`
   - **Windows**: [Download Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install it.
2. Open **Terminal** (Linux) or **Command Prompt** (Windows).
3. Run the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/alianwaar73/dataStructuresC.git
   ```
4. Enter the project directory:
   ```
   cd dataStructuresC
   ```

### 2. Building and Running the Modules

Both modules use **Makefiles** for easy building and cleaning.

#### **A. Linked List Stack (`stackLinkedList`)**

**Navigate to the directory:**
```
cd stackLinkedList
```

**To build the program:**
```
make
```

**To run the program:**
```
./stackADT_linked
```
- On Windows (with MinGW or similar), run:
  ```
  stackADT_linked.exe
  ```

**To clean build files:**
```
make clean
```

#### **B. Array Stack (`stackArray`)**

**Navigate to the directory:**
```
cd stackArray
```

**To build the program:**
```
make
```

**To run the program:**
```
./stack_implementation_array
```
- On Windows:
  ```
  stack_implementation_array.exe
  ```

**To clean build files:**
```
make clean
```

## ðŸ“– Repository Contents

### **stackLinkedList/**

- **stackADT_linked.c**  
  Implements a stack using a singly linked list.  
  **Key Functions:**
  - `initializeStack(Stack* s)`: Initializes a new stack.
  - `isEmpty(Stack* s)`: Checks if the stack is empty.
  - `Push(int element, Stack* s)`: Pushes an element onto the stack.
  - `Pop(Stack* s)`: Pops the top element from the stack.
  - `Top(Stack* s)`: Returns (without popping) the top element.
  - `makeEmpty(Stack* s)`: Empties the entire stack.
  - `printStack(Stack* s)`: Prints the stack contents from top to bottom.

### **stackArray/**

- **stackADT_array.c**  
  Implements a stack using a fixed-size array.  
  **Key Functions:**
  - `Initialise(Stack* s)`: Initializes the array-based stack.
  - `isEmpty(Stack* s)`: Checks if the stack is empty.
  - `isFull(Stack* s)`: Checks if the stack is full.
  - `Push(int element, Stack* s)`: Pushes an element onto the stack.
  - `Pop(Stack* s)`: Pops the top element from the stack.
  - `Top(Stack* s)`: Returns the top element.
  - `makeEmpty(Stack* s)`: Empties the stack.
  - `printStack(Stack* s)`: Prints the stack contents from top to bottom.

Each module is self-contained and includes its own Makefile and header files for modular use and learning.

## ðŸš€ Learning Objectives

- Understand the Stack ADT and its applications.
- Learn the difference between linked list and array implementations of stacks.
- Practice C programming skills: pointers, dynamic memory, arrays, functions, and modular code.
- Experience real-world project organization and compilation tools (Makefiles).
