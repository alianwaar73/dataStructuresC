# Data Structures in C: Stack Abstract Data Type (ADT) â€” Linked List Implementation

Welcome to the companion code repository for an undergraduate course on Data Structures. This repository focuses on the implementation and understanding of the **Stack Abstract Data Type (ADT)** using the C programming language. The code in this repository, specifically in the file `stackADT_linked.c`, demonstrates a classic **linked list implementation of a stack**. This repository is designed for students new to both GitHub and programming in C, with an emphasis on hands-on learning and conceptual clarity.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Set Up and Run the Code

### 1. Downloading the Repository

#### **Option A: Download as ZIP (No GitHub Account Needed)**
1. Go to the repository page in your web browser.
2. Click the green **"Code"** button.
3. Select **"Download ZIP"**.
4. Extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.

#### **Option B: Clone with Git (Recommended for Future Updates)**
1. Install Git if you don't have it:
   - **Linux**: Open Terminal and run:  
     `sudo apt update && sudo apt install git`
   - **Windows**: [Download Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install it.
2. Open **Terminal** (Linux) or **Command Prompt** (Windows).
3. Run the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/alianwaar73/dataStructuresC.git
   ```
4. Enter the project directory:
   ```
   cd dataStructuresC
   ```

### 2. Compiling and Running the Code

#### **Linux Instructions**
1. Open Terminal and navigate to the directory containing `stackADT_linked.c`.
2. Compile the code with:
   ```
   gcc -o stackADT_linked stackADT_linked.c
   ```
   - If you don't have GCC installed, run:  
     `sudo apt install build-essential`
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./stackADT_linked
   ```

#### **Windows Instructions**
1. Open **Command Prompt** and navigate to the directory with `stackADT_linked.c`.
2. Install [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) if you don't have a C compiler.
3. Add `gcc` to your system PATH during installation.
4. Compile the code:
   ```
   gcc -o stackADT_linked.exe stackADT_linked.c
   ```
5. Run the program:
   ```
   stackADT_linked.exe
   ```

## ðŸ“– Repository Contents

- **stackADT_linked.c**:  
  This is the main file of the repository. It contains a simple, clear implementation of a stack using the C language, following the principles of the Stack ADT. The stack is implemented using a linked list structure for maximum flexibility and educational clarity.

### **Functions included:**
- **initialiseStack(Stack* s)**: Initializes a new stack.
- **isEmpty(Stack* s)**: Checks whether the stack is empty.
- **Push(Stack* s, int element)**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop(Stack* s)**: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
- **Top(Stack* s)**: Returns (without removing) the top element of the stack.
- **makeEmpty(Stack* s)**: Empties the entire stack.
- **printStack(Stack* s)**: Prints the contents of the stack.

The program provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the stack, including options to push, pop, check the top element, check if the stack is empty, empty the stack, and print the stack.

Each operation is implemented as a separate function, with clear comments for educational purposes.

## ðŸš€ Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept and use-cases of the Stack ADT.
- Learn how to implement stacks using linked lists in C.
- Practice fundamental C programming skills (pointers, dynamic memory, functions).
- Prepare for more advanced data structures by mastering stack operations.

## ðŸ”® Planned Updates & Repository Organization

- **Upcoming Features**:  
  Future updates will include an **array-based implementation** of the stack in a separate file (e.g., `stackADT_array.c`) to complement the linked-list version. This will help students compare and contrast different approaches to implementing the same ADT.
- **Repository Structure** (planned):
  ```
  dataStructuresC/
    â”œâ”€â”€ stackADT_linked.c      # Current implementation (linked list)
    â”œâ”€â”€ stackADT_array.c       # (Coming soon: array-based version)
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â””â”€â”€ (other data structures and documentation)
  ```
- **Regular Updates**:  
  The repository will be expanded regularly with new code examples, exercises, and additional data structures relevant to the course.
